## Workflow: Quarterly Strategic Planning

### Step 1: Define Strategic Focus

| Strategy        | When to Use                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Growth**      | Scaling user base, market expansion      |
| **Retention**   | Reducing churn, improving LTV            |
| **Revenue**     | Increasing ARPU, new monetization        |
| **Innovation**  | Market differentiation, new capabilities |
| **Operational** | Improving efficiency, scaling operations |

See `references/strategy_types.md` for detailed guidance.

### Step 2: Gather Input Metrics

```json
{
  "current": 100000, // Current MAU
  "target": 150000, // Target MAU
  "current_nps": 40, // Current NPS
  "target_nps": 60 // Target NPS
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Teams & Run Generator

```bash
# Default teams
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth

# Custom org structure with contribution percentage
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth \
  --teams "Core,Platform,Mobile,AI" \
  --contribution 0.3
```

### Step 4: Review Alignment Scores

| Score                | Target   | Action if Below                         |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Vertical Alignment   | >90%     | Ensure all objectives link to parent    |
| Horizontal Alignment | >75%     | Check for team coordination gaps        |
| Coverage             | >80%     | Validate all company OKRs are addressed |
| Balance              | >80%     | Redistribute if one team is overloaded  |
| **Overall**          | **>80%** | <60% needs restructuring                |

### Step 5: Refine, Validate, and Export

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Review generated objectives with stakeholders
- [ ] Adjust team assignments based on capacity
- [ ] Validate contribution percentages are realistic
- [ ] Ensure no conflicting objectives across teams
- [ ] Set up tracking cadence (bi-weekly check-ins)

```bash
# Export JSON for tools like Lattice, Ally, Workboard
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth --json > q1_okrs.json
```

## OKR Cascade Generator

### Usage

```bash
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py [strategy] [options]
```

**Strategies:** `growth` | `retention` | `revenue` | `innovation` | `operational`

### Configuration Options

| Option                 | Description                                | Default                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `--teams`, `-t`        | Comma-separated team names                 | Growth,Platform,Mobile,Data |
| `--contribution`, `-c` | Product contribution to company OKRs (0-1) | 0.3 (30%)                   |
| `--json`, `-j`         | Output as JSON instead of dashboard        | False                       |
| `--metrics`, `-m`      | Metrics as JSON string                     | Sample metrics              |

## Best Practices

### OKR Cascade

- Limit to 3-5 objectives per level, each with 3-5 key results
- Key results must be measurable with current and target values
- Validate parent-child relationships before finalizing

### Alignment Scoring

- Target >80% overall alignment; investigate any score below 60%
- Balance scores ensure no team is overloaded
- Horizontal alignment prevents conflicting goals across teams

### Team Configuration

- Configure teams to match your actual org structure
- Adjust contribution percentages based on team size
- Platform/Infrastructure teams often support all objectives
- Specialized teams (ML, Data) may only support relevant objectives
