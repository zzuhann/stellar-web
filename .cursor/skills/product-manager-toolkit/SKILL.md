## Quick Start

### For Feature Prioritization

```bash
# Create sample data file
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py sample

# Run prioritization with team capacity
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py sample_features.csv --capacity 15
```

### For Interview Analysis

```bash
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py interview_transcript.txt
```

### For PRD Creation

1. Choose template from `references/prd_templates.md`
2. Fill sections based on discovery work
3. Review with engineering for feasibility
4. Version control in project management tool

---

## Core Workflows

### Feature Prioritization Process

```
Gather → Score → Analyze → Plan → Validate → Execute
```

#### Step 1: Gather Feature Requests

- Customer feedback (support tickets, interviews)
- Sales requests (CRM pipeline blockers)
- Technical debt (engineering input)
- Strategic initiatives (leadership goals)

#### Step 2: Score with RICE

```bash
# Input: CSV with features
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20
```

See `references/frameworks.md` for RICE formula and scoring guidelines.

#### Step 3: Analyze Portfolio

Review the tool output for:

- Quick wins vs big bets distribution
- Effort concentration (avoid all XL projects)
- Strategic alignment gaps

#### Step 4: Generate Roadmap

- Quarterly capacity allocation
- Dependency identification
- Stakeholder communication plan

#### Step 5: Validate Results

**Before finalizing the roadmap:**

- [ ] Compare top priorities against strategic goals
- [ ] Run sensitivity analysis (what if estimates are wrong by 2x?)
- [ ] Review with key stakeholders for blind spots
- [ ] Check for missing dependencies between features
- [ ] Validate effort estimates with engineering

#### Step 6: Execute and Iterate

- Share roadmap with team
- Track actual vs estimated effort
- Revisit priorities quarterly
- Update RICE inputs based on learnings

---

### Customer Discovery Process

```
Plan → Recruit → Interview → Analyze → Synthesize → Validate
```

#### Step 1: Plan Research

- Define research questions
- Identify target segments
- Create interview script (see `references/frameworks.md`)

#### Step 2: Recruit Participants

- 5-8 interviews per segment
- Mix of power users and churned users
- Incentivize appropriately

#### Step 3: Conduct Interviews

- Use semi-structured format
- Focus on problems, not solutions
- Record with permission
- Take minimal notes during interview

#### Step 4: Analyze Insights

```bash
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
```

Extracts:

- Pain points with severity
- Feature requests with priority
- Jobs to be done patterns
- Sentiment and key themes
- Notable quotes

#### Step 5: Synthesize Findings

- Group similar pain points across interviews
- Identify patterns (3+ mentions = pattern)
- Map to opportunity areas using Opportunity Solution Tree
- Prioritize opportunities by frequency and severity

#### Step 6: Validate Solutions

**Before building:**

- [ ] Create solution hypotheses (see `references/frameworks.md`)
- [ ] Test with low-fidelity prototypes
- [ ] Measure actual behavior vs stated preference
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Document learnings for future research

### PRD Development Process

```
Scope → Draft → Review → Refine → Approve → Track
```

#### Step 1: Choose Template

Select from `references/prd_templates.md`:

| Template      | Use Case                     | Timeline  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
| Standard PRD  | Complex features, cross-team | 6-8 weeks |
| One-Page PRD  | Simple features, single team | 2-4 weeks |
| Feature Brief | Exploration phase            | 1 week    |
| Agile Epic    | Sprint-based delivery        | Ongoing   |

#### Step 2: Draft Content

- Lead with problem statement
- Define success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state out-of-scope items
- Include wireframes or mockups

#### Step 3: Review Cycle

- Engineering: feasibility and effort
- Design: user experience gaps
- Sales: market validation
- Support: operational impact

#### Step 4: Refine Based on Feedback

- Address technical constraints
- Adjust scope to fit timeline
- Document trade-off decisions

#### Step 5: Approval and Kickoff

- Stakeholder sign-off
- Sprint planning integration
- Communication to broader team

#### Step 6: Track Execution

**After launch:**

- [ ] Compare actual metrics vs targets
- [ ] Conduct user feedback sessions
- [ ] Document what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Update estimation accuracy data
- [ ] Share learnings with team

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall                  | Description                                       | Prevention                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Solution-First**       | Jumping to features before understanding problems | Start every PRD with problem statement |
| **Analysis Paralysis**   | Over-researching without shipping                 | Set time-boxes for research phases     |
| **Feature Factory**      | Shipping features without measuring impact        | Define success metrics before building |
| **Ignoring Tech Debt**   | Not allocating time for platform health           | Reserve 20% capacity for maintenance   |
| **Stakeholder Surprise** | Not communicating early and often                 | Weekly async updates, monthly demos    |
| **Metric Theater**       | Optimizing vanity metrics over real value         | Tie metrics to user value delivered    |

## Best Practices

**Writing Great PRDs:**

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Include clear success metrics upfront
- Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Use visuals (wireframes, flows, diagrams)
- Keep technical details in appendix
- Version control all changes

**Effective Prioritization:**

- Mix quick wins with strategic bets
- Consider opportunity cost of delays
- Account for dependencies between features
- Buffer 20% for unexpected work
- Revisit priorities quarterly
- Communicate decisions with context

**Customer Discovery:**

- Ask "why" five times to find root cause
- Focus on past behavior, not future intentions
- Avoid leading questions ("Wouldn't you love...")
- Interview in the user's natural environment
- Watch for emotional reactions (pain = opportunity)
- Validate qualitative with quantitative data
