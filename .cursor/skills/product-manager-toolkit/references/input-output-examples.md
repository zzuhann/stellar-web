### Customer Interview Analyzer Example

**Input (interview.txt):**

```
Customer: Jane, Enterprise PM at TechCorp
Date: 2024-01-15

Interviewer: What's the hardest part of your current workflow?

Jane: The biggest frustration is the lack of real-time collaboration.
When I'm working on a PRD, I have to constantly ping my team on Slack
to get updates. It's really frustrating to wait for responses,
especially when we're on a tight deadline.

I've tried using Google Docs for collaboration, but it doesn't
integrate with our roadmap tools. I'd pay extra for something that
just worked seamlessly.

Interviewer: How often does this happen?

Jane: Literally every day. I probably waste 30 minutes just on
back-and-forth messages. It's my biggest pain point right now.
