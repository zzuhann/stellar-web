## What Are OKRs

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** are a goal-setting framework that connects organizational strategy to measurable outcomes.

### Components

| Component      | Definition               | Characteristics                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Objective**  | What you want to achieve | Qualitative, inspirational, time-bound |
| **Key Result** | How you measure progress | Quantitative, specific, measurable     |

### OKR Formula

```
Objective: [Inspirational goal statement]
├── KR1: [Metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]
├── KR2: [Metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]
└── KR3: [Metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]
```

### Example

```
Objective: Become the go-to solution for enterprise customers

KR1: Increase enterprise ARR from $5M to $8M
KR2: Improve enterprise NPS from 35 to 50
KR3: Reduce enterprise onboarding time from 30 days to 14 days
```

## The Cascade Model

OKRs cascade from company strategy down to individual teams, ensuring alignment at every level.

### Cascade Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           COMPANY LEVEL                 │
│  Strategic objectives set by leadership │
│  Owned by: CEO, Executive Team          │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          PRODUCT LEVEL                  │
│  How product org contributes to company │
│  Owned by: Head of Product, CPO         │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            TEAM LEVEL                   │
│  Specific initiatives and deliverables  │
│  Owned by: Product Managers, Tech Leads │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Contribution Model

Each level contributes a percentage to the level above:

| Level             | Typical Contribution | Range  |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Product → Company | 30%                  | 20-50% |
| Team → Product    | 25% per team         | 15-35% |

**Note:** Contribution percentages should be calibrated based on:

- Number of teams
- Relative team size
- Strategic importance of initiatives

### Alignment Types

| Alignment      | Description                           | Goal                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Vertical**   | Each level supports the level above   | >90% of objectives linked |
| **Horizontal** | Teams coordinate on shared objectives | No conflicting goals      |
| **Temporal**   | Quarterly OKRs support annual goals   | Clear progression         |

## Writing Effective Objectives

### The 3 Cs of Objectives

| Criterion       | Description            | Example                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear**       | Unambiguous intent     | "Improve customer onboarding" not "Make things better" |
| **Compelling**  | Inspires action        | "Delight enterprise customers" not "Serve enterprise"  |
| **Challenging** | Stretches capabilities | Achievable but requires effort                         |

### Objective Templates by Strategy

**Growth Strategy:**

```
- Accelerate user acquisition in [segment]
- Expand market presence in [region/vertical]
- Build sustainable acquisition channels
```

**Retention Strategy:**

```

- Maximize customer lifetime value
```

**Revenue Strategy:**

```
- Drive revenue growth through [mechanism]
- Optimize monetization for [segment]
- Expand revenue per customer
```

**Innovation Strategy:**

```
- Pioneer [capability] in the market
- Establish leadership through [innovation area]
- Build competitive differentiation
```

**Operational Strategy:**

```
- Improve delivery efficiency by [mechanism]
- Scale operations to support [target]
- Reduce operational friction in [area]
```

### Objective Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern       | Problem             | Better Alternative                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Increase revenue" | Too vague           | "Grow enterprise ARR to $10M"           |
| "Be the best"      | Not measurable      | "Achieve #1 NPS in category"            |
| "Fix bugs"         | Too tactical        | "Improve platform reliability"          |
| "Launch feature X" | Output, not outcome | "Improve [metric] through [capability]" |

## Defining Key Results

### Key Result Anatomy

```
[Verb] [metric] from [current baseline] to [target] by [deadline]
```

### Key Result Types

| Type                | Characteristics  | When to Use                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Metric-based**    | Track a number   | Most common, highly measurable |
| **Milestone-based** | Track completion | For binary deliverables        |
| **Health-based**    | Track stability  | For maintenance objectives     |

### Metric Categories

| Category         | Examples                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Acquisition**  | Signups, trials started, leads generated       |
| **Activation**   | Onboarding completion, first value moment      |
| **Retention**    | D7/D30 retention, churn rate, repeat usage     |
| **Revenue**      | ARR, ARPU, conversion rate, LTV                |
| **Engagement**   | DAU/MAU, session duration, actions per session |
| **Satisfaction** | NPS, CSAT, support tickets                     |
| **Efficiency**   | Cycle time, automation rate, cost per unit     |

### Key Result Scoring

| Score   | Status   | Description                         |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 0.0-0.3 | Red      | Significant gap, needs intervention |
| 0.4-0.6 | Yellow   | Partial progress, on watch          |
| 0.7-0.9 | Green    | Strong progress, on track           |
| 1.0     | Complete | Target achieved                     |

**Note:** Hitting 0.7 is considered success for stretch goals. Consistently hitting 1.0 suggests targets aren't ambitious enough.

## Alignment Scoring

The OKR cascade generator calculates alignment scores across four dimensions:

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension                | Weight | What It Measures                        |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Vertical Alignment**   | 40%    | % of objectives with parent links       |
| **Horizontal Alignment** | 20%    | Cross-team coordination on shared goals |
| **Coverage**             | 20%    | % of company KRs addressed by product   |
| **Balance**              | 20%    | Even distribution of work across teams  |

### Alignment Score Interpretation

| Score   | Grade | Interpretation                     |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| 90-100% | A     | Excellent alignment, well-cascaded |
| 80-89%  | B     | Good alignment, minor gaps         |
| 70-79%  | C     | Adequate, needs attention          |
| 60-69%  | D     | Poor alignment, significant gaps   |
| <60%    | F     | Misaligned, requires restructuring |

### Target Benchmarks

| Metric               | Target | Red Flag |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Vertical alignment   | >90%   | <70%     |
| Horizontal alignment | >75%   | <50%     |
| Coverage             | >80%   | <60%     |
| Balance              | >80%   | <60%     |
| Overall              | >80%   | <65%     |

## Common Pitfalls

### OKR Anti-Patterns

| Pitfall                | Symptom                       | Fix                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Too many OKRs**      | 10+ objectives per level      | Limit to 3-5 objectives             |
| **Sandbagging**        | Always hit 100%               | Set stretch targets (0.7 = success) |
| **Task lists**         | KRs are tasks, not outcomes   | Focus on measurable impact          |
| **Set and forget**     | No mid-quarter reviews        | Check-ins every 2 weeks             |
| **Cascade disconnect** | Team OKRs don't link up       | Validate parent relationships       |
| **Metric gaming**      | Optimizing for KR, not intent | Balance with health metrics         |

### Warning Signs

- All teams have identical objectives (lack of specialization)
- No team owns a critical company objective (gap in coverage)
- One team owns everything (unrealistic load)
- Objectives change weekly (lack of commitment)
- KRs are activities, not outcomes (wrong focus)

## OKR Cadence

### Quarterly Rhythm

| Week        | Activity                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Week -2** | Leadership sets company OKRs draft    |
| **Week -1** | Product and team OKR drafting         |
| **Week 0**  | OKR finalization and alignment review |
| **Week 2**  | First check-in, adjust if needed      |
| **Week 6**  | Mid-quarter review                    |
| **Week 10** | Pre-quarter reflection                |
| **Week 12** | Quarter close, scoring, learnings     |

### Check-in Format

```
Weekly/Bi-weekly Status Update:

1. Confidence level: [Red/Yellow/Green]
2. Progress since last check-in: [specific updates]
3. Blockers: [what's in the way]
4. Asks: [what help is needed]
5. Forecast: [expected end-of-quarter score]
```

### Annual Alignment

Quarterly OKRs should ladder up to annual goals:

```
Annual Goal: Become a $100M ARR business

Q1: Build enterprise sales motion (ARR: $25M → $32M)
Q2: Expand into APAC region (ARR: $32M → $45M)
Q3: Launch self-serve enterprise tier (ARR: $45M → $65M)
Q4: Scale and optimize (ARR: $65M → $100M)
```
